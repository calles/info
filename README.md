**Syllabus Physics**

Maastricht University will assess whether you can demonstrate sufficient knowledge of the compulsory subject Physics and therefore qualify for an exemption (sufficiëntieverklaring) for this subject on an individual basis. This assessment is based on the information you provide in the syllabus and must meet the attainment aims for final examination in Dutch secondary education (VWO) in the relevant subject and the national agreements made within the Central Commissions Pre-examination (in Dutch: CCVX) and Boswell Bèta.

For the assessment the following items on the candidate's Physics curriculum will be investigated:
- Description, coverage and level of relevant Physics topics/domains
- Annual number of contact hours over the last three years of education
- Application of mathematical methods to solve technical and scientific problems in a quantitative way
- Conducting of and reporting on laboratory experiments/practical sessions and measurements

The syllabus must meet the following requirements in order for it to be assessed:
*   All mandatory items must be filled in completely and carefully.
*   The syllabus must be filled in either in Dutch or English.
*   It must be submitted as one PDF file.
*   The file must not exceed 10 MB.

Please note that only the information actually included in the syllabus will be assessed. Links or references to other information will not be followed.

Please note: The assessment of your syllabus may take some time, so submit your syllabus as soon as possible, preferably **before 1 November 2024**.

**Personal details***

**ID/Student number:**
`i6414578`
(This is the user ID that you use to logon to 'My Applicant portal')

**First- and last name:**
`CLAUDIA`
`PALOMERA`

*The completion of Personal details is mandatory

**Remark:** complete this syllabus as carefully as possible and provide clear and relevant supporting documents. You can only have the syllabus assessed once.
In case of a negative assessment, if you raise an objection, this syllabus as submitted by you, will be reviewed by a second assessor. New information/evidence will not be assessed.
